## This project aims at calibrating ice dynamical parameters using Bayesian calibration and Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs), also known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

EFOs can be computed directly with the Climate Data Operators (CDO, <https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/>) or with the python module PCA (<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html>)
