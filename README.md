## Introduction

pism-emulator is the codebase for the two-step Bayesian calibration process proposed by Aschwanden and Brinkerhoff [1]. The goal is to condition ensemble predictions of Greenland's contribution to future sea-level on contemporary [surface speeds](https://nsidc.org/data/NSIDC-0670/versions/1) and [cumulative mass loss](http://imbie.org).

## Methods

1. We first calibrate ice dynamics parameters using artificial neural network to act as a surrogate for the ice flow model, which provides a mapping from ice flow parameters to surface speeds at a fraction of PISM's computational cost. This method also provides us the means to employ efficient statistical methods that rely on the gradients of model outputs with respect to its input. We then find the joint marginal distributions given surface speed observations [Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis-adjusted_Langevin_algorithm) (MALA), a Markov-chain Monte Carlo Method. Both the surrogate model and the MALA sampler are implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [PyTorch-Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai) and can be run on GPUs.

2. In the second step, we use Bayesian calibration, also known as [Importance Sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_sampling) to condition ensemble members on observations of cumulative mass change.

## Minimal Example

No need to download large data sets. A low-resolution working example is provided as a notebook [`minimal_example.ipynb`](https://github.com/pism/pism-emulator/blob/master/notebooks/minimal_example.ipyng)

## Procedure

1. Download observations of [surface speeds](https://nsidc.org/data/NSIDC-0670/versions/1) and [cumulative mass loss](http://imbie.org).

Generate training data. The current implementation uses training data generated by the [Parallel Ice Sheet Model](https://pism.io) although it can be adapted to work with other ice sheet models as well. Download the training data from arcticdata.io and

2. Train the surrogate model.
